    <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">ax + b = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="letter">a</span> and <span class="letter">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="letter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="letter">x</span> so don't get too locked into alawy seeing an <span class="letter">x</span> there.</p>
    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>
    <p>where <span class="letter">a</span>,<span class="letter">b</span>,<span class="letter">c</span> are known values and <span class="letter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="letter">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <p><span class="letter">&pi;</span>(Pi) times the radius (<span class="letter">r</span>) squared.</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="letter">D</span>):</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">A = (&pi;/4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    or, when you know the circumference (<span class="letter">C</span>):
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span></p>
    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="letter">A</span> and <span class="letter">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="formula">A &cap; B = {x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B}</span></p>
    That is, <span class="letter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="letter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="letter">A</span> and an element of <span class="letter">B</span>.
